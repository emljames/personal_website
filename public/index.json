Given that lots of people are currently moving their data collection procedures online, we will use an output file from Gorilla as an example. However, the tools should readily apply regardless of your data collection software.\nIn the first part of the tutorial, we will cover the basics of extracting the relevant data from your output files. In Part 2, we will cover some extra tips and tricks for monitoring sample size during online data collection, scaling up the tools to more complex datasets, and re-organising your data flexibly.\n Knowledge required This introduction is aimed at beginners, with very little experience coding in R.\nHowever, it does assume that you can find your way around R Studio (i.e., familiar with the script and console, how to run one/several lines of code), and navigate your working directory to access your data. A basic understanding of functions and arguments will also help. Some recommended resources on this are:\n  Data Carpentries  Introductory chapter in R for Data Science (Hadley Wickham)  If you prefer some light interactive activities, you can also try:\n  DataCamp - R Onboarding  Codeacademy - R   What\u0026rsquo;s this \u0026ldquo;tidyverse\u0026rdquo; you speak of? As with most programming tasks, there are multiple different ways of achieving the same thing. Within the R programming language, there are some clusters of approaches (\u0026ldquo;dialects\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;grammars\u0026rdquo;, if you like). It\u0026rsquo;s not essential to acknowledge the difference - mostly you will settle for whatever tools you can get to work! However, you will see when searching your issues on StackExchange that many people provide alternative solutions, and will often refer to using Base R, the tidyverse (including dplyr, tidyr packages), and data.table. This document will focus on data manipulation using the tidyverse.\nWhat are the pros?\n Intuitive functions - they pretty much do what they say on the tin. Readable and tidy - once you have understood a few key features (e.g., the pipe operator), it\u0026rsquo;s relatively easy to read an existing script and gauge what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Efficient - you can carry out your data processing tasks in relatively few lines of code (as we will see here!) Wide usership - there is a huge amount of support available online.  \u0026hellip;and the cons?\n Coders transferring from different programming languages sometimes prefer base R operations, as they more directly relate to their existing knowledge. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t handle big data particularly well (the data.table package is better suited to this). But I really do mean big data here (i.e., sourced from rich naturally occurring datasets), most experimental data should be fine.  For me, learning to use the tidyverse took me from years of copying and pasting random bits of code from the internet, to being able to sit down and write a data processing script from scratch. I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll find it helpful too!\nReady?

In our recent study, we asked whether their vocabulary problems lie in what happens during sleep.\nWe taught children the names of unusual animals and plants. Some particular favourites were the shaggy komondor dog and the rainbow deglupta tree, pictured below1. The words were split across two sets of learning and test sessions. In one set children learned the new words first thing in the morning, and in the other set they learned the new words at the end of the evening. Straight after each learning session, they completed some memory tests for the words they had learned. Children then sat the same tests again 12 and 24 hours later, allowing us to trace how their memory changed over wake and sleep.\n\r \r \r\rChildren were better at remembering the new words after they had slept. This memory boost lasted across the next day, even when children were tired again the following evening. Sleep was most beneficial when children learned the words right before their bedtime. In fact, when we visited again a month later, children were still better at remembering the words they had learned in the evening.\nThe children with reading comprehension difficulties found it harder to learn the new words. Even so, their memory still improved over sleep. Learning close to bedtime may be especially helpful for the children with a vocabulary weakness. Children with poor vocabulary were less likely to show sleep benefits for words learned earlier in the day. Nevertheless, all children showed sleep benefits for words learned in the evening.\nSo sleep is more than an opportunity for rest: it’s important for storing new words in long-term memory. Children with reading comprehension difficulties were equally able to benefit from sleep to retain their new knowledge, even though they found it harder to learn the words to start with. It may be that we can capitalise on sleep best if the information is fresh in our memory before we go to bed. This suggests that timing could play an important role in maximising learning – particularly for children with weaker vocabulary knowledge. For these children, a book at bedtime may be an especially valuable language learning opportunity.\nThis post was a summary of: Sleep-dependent consolidation in children with comprehension and vocabulary weaknesses: It’ll be alright on the night?

I mentioned that we had recently collected vocal responses online, but that I didn’t have time to talk about it. So, here’s a little bit more about my experiences.\nWe collected spoken responses as part of a word learning study. 125 participants were recruited via Prolific, and listened to a spoken story containing made-up words. In each of three test sessions (same day, next day, one week later), we asked them to try and recall the made-up words. We presented them with the starting sound for each word, and asked them to try and speak the whole word that they had heard in the story. We were interested in which words participants could remember at each test point, scoring each trial as correct or incorrect.\nThe tools The experiment was programmed in Gorilla, and we collected spoken responses using the “Audio Recording Zone”. This zone is still in BETA testing (at the time of posting), which means that Gorilla are still ironing out a few issues. We did some thorough piloting and made it through relatively problem-free, but Gorilla have added some warnings of issues to be aware of.\nThe zone includes a “Test Mode” option, which is Gorilla’s built-in tool for participants to test whether their microphones are working. This mode creates a short recording of the participant’s voice and plays it back to them so that they can check they can be heard. Note that this relies on their honesty though \u0026ndash; there is no way for the software itself to check sound quality, or for you to know that recordings are OK before the participant proceeds.\nWithin your experimental task, you incorporate the zone on the relevant trial screen as you would any other response zone in Gorilla, and set the option to “Record Mode”. This will record a short sound file for each trial, which can be ended by a button press or a timeout (you can see the various setting options in the guidance). At the end of my experiment, I downloaded a short .mp3 file for each word trial for each participant.\nI used CheckVocal (Protopapas, 2007) for scoring each recording as correct or incorrect. CheckVocal is freely available software that was originally designed to process naming data from DMDX software. Although these recordings were collected via Gorilla, it still did the job for me (after converting the files to .wav first). You can download the software from github.\nThe tips OK, so I’ve only run one experiment \u0026ndash; I don’t have a HUGE wealth of knowledge to offer. But here are the steps I took (or would take next time!) to try and maintain data quality:\n Put a test mode at the very start of your experiment. I put this even before the main study information and consent form, as no data is collected at this stage. Ask participants to change their settings until their audio is clear. If they can’t get it to work, they can return to Prolific with very little time lost, thereby minimising expensive data loss for you. Repeat the test mode before the recording part of your task. You might not need to do this, but I repeated the recording tasks in subsequent test sessions and wanted to provide an opportunity for re-adjustment if needed. Plus it doesn’t harm to be a little extra cautious! Create your own test recording. The test modes don’t store any data for you, so I added my own test trial. I asked participants to speak “Take me to the task” before starting the experiment, which served three main purposes:  It gave me a quick reference trial to check before approving the participant\u0026rsquo;s submission on Prolific. Checking data quality before approval provides an opportunity to query any issues at a stage when participants are likely to respond. It provided a reference trial for subsequent scoring. Blank sound files are very hard to interpret (see below), so evidence of the participant’s microphone working during that test session can be helpful. It reinforced that sound recording was a vital part of the experiment, and that participants shouldn’t try to proceed without it.   (And an extra point – it was wonderful listening to all the kind strangers with their various accents asking to be taken to the experiment!)   Avoid blank sound files. Empty recordings can be very hard to interpret: they tend to consist of only white noise, and/or might be very short. This leaves you with no idea whether the participant didn’t attempt a response or whether the recording didn\u0026rsquo;t work properly. To help with this, we encouraged participants to attempt an answer if they could, and speak “don’t know” or “pass” if not. The majority of participants did this, but I think in future I would keep a reminder on-screen. Don’t expect a lab-based environment. Before starting this experiment, I had an idealised view that I would be able to tell if a participant wasn’t in an appropriately quiet environment, and that it would be easy to exclude them on that basis. It isn’t. You have no real idea whether that faint music/television is in the same room and whether the participants can hear it through their headphones. You don’t know how distracted that participant is from the children screaming at each other (OK I might have had to exclude that trial…). You might even hear your participants take an extra moment to ask their co-habitant to be quiet. Then what? …Think very carefully about the implications of background noise for your research question, and remember that you will never have the same control as in the lab. This goes for any online study \u0026mdash; it just becomes more obvious when collecting sound recordings. Of course, you will ask that your participants are in a quiet environment where they are unlikely to be disturbed, but if this is crucial to your experiment then you will really need to spell out exactly what that means and think through your criteria for exclusion. For me, my main measure was the accuracy of the word remembered (response times didn\u0026rsquo;t matter) and I had other ways to ensure that participants were engaging with the task. I was also comparing this experiment to one conducted with children in schools \u0026ndash; background noise and screaming children are pretty common occurrences there too.  I think that’s all I can think of that might be helpful, but please feel free to leave comments with any further questions or your own tips and experiences.

This study examined lexical neighbourhood structure during incidental word learning—limiting opportunities for strategically engaging prior knowledge—and tested the hypothesis that prior knowledge would provide additional support during subsequent consolidation. Children (Experiment 1) and adults (Experiments 2, 3) were presented with 15 pseudowords embedded in spoken stories, and then tested on their recognition and recall of the new word-forms immediately, the next day, and one week later. The pseudowords had either no, one, or many English phonological neighbours, varying the potential connections to existing knowledge. After hearing the pseudowords in a spoken story context, children did not benefit from phonological neighbours in recall, and were better at recognising items without neighbours. Adults showed a recall benefit for pseudowords with lexical neighbours when they could read along with the story (Experiment 2), but this benefit was less apparent when written text was removed (Experiment 3). The neighbour influence did not change with opportunities for consolidation in any experiment, nor did it relate to learners’ existing vocabulary ability. Exploratory analyses revealed that children experienced bigger benefits from offline consolidation overall, with adults outperforming children only for many-neighbour items one week after exposure. We discuss how the neighbour benefit in word learning may be constrained by learning context, and how the enhanced benefits of offline consolidation earlier in development extend to vocabulary learning in more naturalistic contexts.","tags":["Vocabulary","Word learning","Consolidation","Prior knowledge"],"title":"The role of prior lexical knowledge in children’s and adults’ word learning from stories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emma James","Yolanda G.

Progress is often slow to begin with. It takes a while to work out how the thousands of tiny pieces fit within the bigger picture. A bit further down the line, you might have an outline. You\u0026rsquo;ve clustered some pieces together in their approximate space. The further you get in building the framework, the easier it becomes for you to place each individual piece. This phenomenon is true of learning new topics too \u0026mdash; we build cognitive frameworks that make it easier to learn related information. Yet, we don\u0026rsquo;t know much about how language learners use their prior knowledge. We asked, do children with better vocabulary knowledge find it easier to learn new words?\nTo look at this question, we re-analysed data from five experiments of word learning in children. Each experiment involved teaching children some made-up words (for example, dolpheg) that were similar to real words in English (dolphin). Researchers then tested whether the two words became integrated in vocabulary. The integration task measured how quickly the children could detect a short pause inserted into the real words (e.g., dolph__in), to see whether the made-up words were competing for recognition. When a new word is integrated into vocabulary, response times slow down. The studies each found that sleep was important for this integration to happen: the new words interfered with children’s ability to process real words only when tested the next day.\nWe re-analysed the data from these experiments to look at how word learning might depend on children\u0026rsquo;s prior knowledge. Children’s prior knowledge was assessed using a separate vocabulary test. We found that children with weak prior knowledge were less likely to embed new words into vocabulary overnight. Children with better prior knowledge were more likely to integrate new and known words. So what might be happening differently for these children overnight?\nWhen we first learn a new word, a region of the brain called the hippocampus creates a memory of it. It stores information about its sound, its meaning, and its connections to words we know. Those known words are stored in neocortical (outer) regions of the brain. During sleep, new memories are reorganised in the brain so that they too become part of this long-term knowledge. This is achieved by the hippocampus replaying and reactivating the new word memory. As a result, the connections between new and known words become stronger, and the new words become part of long-term vocabulary. We think that children with better prior knowledge can make more connections between new and known words during learning. With more connections, they experience bigger benefits from memory replay during sleep.\nChildren who have a better language framework seem to more readily lay down each word “piece” of the language puzzle overnight. However, there are many reasons why children who do well at vocabulary assessments might also do well on these measures of word learning. Our research is trying to understand this relationship better. Which aspects of learning benefit most from prior knowledge? Do adults rely on prior knowledge more than children? How can this help us to understand atypical language development? I’ll be addressing these questions in the coming months. By better understanding how children use their existing knowledge during word learning, we hope to better understand why some children lag behind in vocabulary growth. Our finding that existing knowledge supports later integration of new words into long-term memory tells us that the answer might lie beyond initial vocabulary instruction.\nThis post was a summary of: Consolidation of vocabulary during sleep: The rich get richer?

For example, we might experience going to the park with a relative and finding a lost handbag there, and later find we remember that story upon visiting the park again.\nAs a postdoc in the York Episodic Memory Lab, I worked on a project trying to understand the processes that support this kind of memory, and how they change across development. We had to make some changes to the classic research tasks to make them child-friendly, which unintentionally ended up telling us a bit about the processes involved in itself! The developmental aspect of the study is still ongoing.\n","date":1588723200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597252372,"objectID":"c048c8b1ada788e5e3322ffc589445b9","permalink":"/project/developmental-loops/","publishdate":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/developmental-loops/","section":"project","summary":"2019: Postdoctoral research with Dr Aidan Horner","tags":["memory","development"],"title":"Understanding memory processes across development","type":"project"},{"authors":["Emma James","M.

Why do some children find word learning harder than others, and what happens to word memories in the longer term? Together with Dr Lisa Henderson and Professor Gareth Gaskell, we looked at how word learning might build on existing vocabulary knowledge.\nWe approached this question in three main ways. First, we looked at how individuals\u0026rsquo; existing vocabulary knowledged predicted their ability to learn and consolidate new words. Second, we manipulated the ways in which new words could relate to prior knowledge, and looked at how it affected word learning success. Third, we looked at children who often find word learning difficult, as is characteristic of children with reading comprehension difficulties.\n","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590164714,"objectID":"84b5963d0b89a5302955fff35af19dc6","permalink":"/project/phd-work/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/phd-work/","section":"project","summary":"2014--2019: PhD research with Dr Lisa Henderson and Prof. Gareth Gaskell","tags":["vocabulary","learning","consolidation","development","literacy"],"title":"Individual differences in word learning and consolidation","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic  Academic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click  PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
