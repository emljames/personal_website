Given that lots of people are currently moving their data collection procedures online, we will use an output file from Gorilla as an example. However, the tools should readily apply regardless of your data collection software.\nIn the first part of the tutorial, we will cover the basics of extracting the relevant data from your output files. In Part 2, we will cover some extra tips and tricks for monitoring sample size during online data collection, scaling up the tools to more complex datasets, and re-organising your data flexibly.\n Knowledge required This introduction is aimed at beginners, with very little experience coding in R.\nHowever, it does assume that you can find your way around R Studio (i.e., familiar with the script and console, how to run one/several lines of code), and navigate your working directory to access your data. A basic understanding of functions and arguments will also help. Some recommended resources on this are:\n  Data Carpentries  Introductory chapter in R for Data Science (Hadley Wickham)  If you prefer some light interactive activities, you can also try:\n  DataCamp - R Onboarding  Codeacademy - R   What\u0026rsquo;s this \u0026ldquo;tidyverse\u0026rdquo; you speak of? As with most programming tasks, there are multiple different ways of achieving the same thing. Within the R programming language, there are some clusters of approaches (\u0026ldquo;dialects\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;grammars\u0026rdquo;, if you like). It\u0026rsquo;s not essential to acknowledge the difference - mostly you will settle for whatever tools you can get to work! However, you will see when searching your issues on StackExchange that many people provide alternative solutions, and will often refer to using Base R, the tidyverse (including dplyr, tidyr packages), and data.table. This document will focus on data manipulation using the tidyverse.\nWhat are the pros?\n Intuitive functions - they pretty much do what they say on the tin. Readable and tidy - once you have understood a few key features (e.g., the pipe operator), it\u0026rsquo;s relatively easy to read an existing script and gauge what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Efficient - you can carry out your data processing tasks in relatively few lines of code (as we will see here!) Wide usership - there is a huge amount of support available online.  \u0026hellip;and the cons?\n Coders transferring from different programming languages sometimes prefer base R operations, as they more directly relate to their existing knowledge. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t handle big data particularly well (the data.table package is better suited to this). But I really do mean big data here (i.e., sourced from rich naturally occurring datasets), most experimental data should be fine.  For me, learning to use the tidyverse took me from years of copying and pasting random bits of code from the internet, to being able to sit down and write a data processing script from scratch. I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll find it helpful too!\nReady?

Progress is often slow to begin with. It takes a while to work out how the thousands of tiny pieces fit within the bigger picture. A bit further down the line, you might have an outline. You\u0026rsquo;ve clustered some pieces together in their approximate space. The further you get in building the framework, the easier it becomes for you to place each individual piece. This phenomenon is true of learning new topics too: we build cognitive frameworks that make it easier to learn related information. However, we don’t often consider how language learners use their prior knowledge. Do children with better vocabulary knowledge find it easier to learn new words?\nTo look at this question, we re-analysed data from five experiments of word learning in children. Each experiment involved teaching children some made-up words (for example, dolpheg) that were similar to real words in English (dolphin). Researchers then tested whether the two words became integrated in vocabulary. The integration task measured how quickly the children could detect a short pause inserted into the real words (e.g., dolph__in), to see whether the made-up words were competing for recognition. When a new word is integrated into vocabulary, response times slow down. The studies each found that sleep was important for this integration to happen: the new words interfered with children’s ability to process real words only when tested the next day.\nWe re-analysed the data from these experiments to look at how word learning might depend on children\u0026rsquo;s prior knowledge. Children’s prior knowledge was assessed using a separate vocabulary test. We found that children with weak prior knowledge were less likely to embed new words into vocabulary overnight. Children with better prior knowledge were more likely to integrate new and known words. So what might be happening differently for these children overnight?\nWhen we first learn a new word, a region of the brain called the hippocampus creates a memory of it. It stores information about its sound, its meaning, and its connections to words we know. Those known words are stored in neocortical (outer) regions of the brain. During sleep, new memories are reorganised in the brain so that they too become part of this long-term knowledge. This is achieved by the hippocampus replaying and reactivating the new word memory. As a result, the connections between new and known words become stronger, and the new words become part of long-term vocabulary. We think that children with better prior knowledge can make more connections between new and known words during learning. With more connections, they experience bigger benefits from memory replay during sleep.\nChildren who have a better language framework seem to more readily lay down each word “piece” of the language puzzle overnight. However, there are many reasons why children who do well at vocabulary assessments might also do well on these measures of word learning. Our research is trying to understand this relationship better. Which aspects of learning benefit most from prior knowledge? Do adults rely on prior knowledge more than children? How can this help us to understand atypical language development? I’ll be addressing these questions in the coming months. By better understanding how children use their existing knowledge during word learning, we hope to better understand why some children lag behind in vocabulary growth.\nThis post was a summary of: Consolidation of vocabulary during sleep: The rich get richer?

Can we target sleep problems to help with learning difficulties? Might we remember information better if we sleep straight after learning it? However, our understanding of sleep and word learning mostly comes from lab experiments, which control lots of other things about the learning environment. This means that the benefits of sleep might not be as apparent in real-world learning.\nIn this project, we ask whether there is observable evidence for sleep-associated benefits in everyday language learning. Using app data from the foreign language-learning platform Memrise, we are testing whether memory for new words is better after a period of sleep compared to a period of wake.

Studies show that memory for individual event elements (e.g., person, object, and location) are statistically related to each other, and that the same associative memory structure can be formed by learning all pairwise associations across separated encoding contexts (person-object, person-location, object-location). Counter to previous studies that have shown no differences in holistic retrieval between simultaneously and separately encoded event elements, adults did not show evidence of holistic retrieval from separately encoded event elements when using a similar paradigm adapted for children (Experiment 1). We conducted a further five online experiments to explore the conditions under which holistic retrieval emerges following separated encoding of within-event associations, testing for influences of trial length (Experiment 2), the number of events learned (Experiment 3a), and stimulus presentation format (Experiments 3b, 4a, 4b). Presentation of written words was optimal for integrating elements across encoding trials, whereas use of spoken words and pictures disrupted integration across separately presented associations. These findings potentially highlight the importance of visual imagery processes for integrating event elements across encoding contexts, and have practical implications for the utility of this paradigm across research and learning contexts.","tags":["Memory","Episodic memory"],"title":"Make or break it: Boundary conditions for integrating multiple elements in episodic memory","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic  Academic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click  PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
