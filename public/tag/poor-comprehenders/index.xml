      <title>From little to large: the importance of understanding morphemes for understanding texts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you can bear to read the news at the moment, you will likely come across words you had no reason to encounter before 2020. How is it that we can so readily skim over new terms such as &lt;em&gt;maskless&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;super-spreader&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;pre-lockdown&lt;/em&gt;? Well, these words are each built from smaller units of meaning called morphemes. We know that &lt;em&gt;–less&lt;/em&gt; means “without”, adding &lt;em&gt;–er&lt;/em&gt; refers to a person that does something, and &lt;em&gt;pre-&lt;/em&gt; means “before”. This awareness of morphemes can help us understand language even when words are unfamiliar. Thus, morphological awareness likely helps developing readers as they face increasingly challenging texts. We put this proposal to the test in our recent study of reading comprehension in 6- to 13-year-old children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed six tasks to assess three different types of morphology: compounds, inflections, and derivations (described in the table below). We assessed awareness of each type in two ways. In one task, children chose the most appropriate transformation between options. In the other, children produced a morphological transformation themselves. The tasks included both real and made-up words, to make sure they were measuring more than just vocabulary knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;img src=&#34;task_table.png&#34; alt=&#34;Tasks used to assess different types of morphology&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across all three age groups (6-8 years, 9-11 years, 12-13 years), children’s morphological awareness scores were strongly related to their reading comprehension ability. The crucial test was to see whether morphological awareness explained differences in reading comprehension over and above other important skills, such as phonological awareness (the ability to isolate and manipulate sounds in words), vocabulary, nonverbal reasoning, and reading accuracy. For the 6-8 and 12-13 year olds, we found that morphological awareness further improved the prediction of reading comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also some indication that morphological awareness was particularly important for children with weak comprehension, whereas vocabulary was a stronger predictor for good comprehenders. However, these differences were small and not clear-cut. All in all, both morphological awareness &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; vocabulary played important roles in reading comprehension across the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this study shows that morphological awareness does have a unique role to play in reading comprehension: it adds something more to comprehension ability than the skills we typically measure in the classroom. Importantly, it predicts reading comprehension from beginning readers to adolescents, and across a wide range of abilities. This finding illustrates the importance of incorporating morphology instruction throughout literacy development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep helps us to learn new words, but children with reading comprehension difficulties often have poor memory for new vocabulary. In our recent study, we asked whether their vocabulary problems lie in what happens during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We taught children the names of unusual animals and plants. Some particular favourites were the shaggy &lt;em&gt;komondor&lt;/em&gt; dog and the rainbow &lt;em&gt;deglupta&lt;/em&gt; tree, pictured below&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The words were split across two sets of learning and test sessions. In one set children learned the new words first thing in the morning, and in the other set they learned the new words at the end of the evening. Straight after each learning session, they completed some memory tests for the words they had learned. Children then sat the same tests again 12 and 24 hours later, allowing us to trace how their memory changed over wake and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;komondor.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo of a komondor dog&#34; style=&#34;width: 282px;&#34;/&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;deglupta.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo of a deglupta tree&#34; style=&#34;width: 200px;&#34;/&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children were better at remembering the new words after they had slept. This memory boost lasted across the next day, even when children were tired again the following evening. Sleep was most beneficial when children learned the words right before their bedtime. In fact, when we visited again a month later, children were still better at remembering the words they had learned in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children with reading comprehension difficulties found it harder to learn the new words. Even so, their memory still improved over sleep. Learning close to bedtime may be especially helpful for the children with a vocabulary weakness. Children with poor vocabulary were less likely to show sleep benefits for words learned earlier in the day. Nevertheless, all children showed sleep benefits for words learned in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So sleep is more than an opportunity for rest: it’s important for storing new words in long-term memory. Children with reading comprehension difficulties were equally able to benefit from sleep to retain their new knowledge, even though they found it harder to learn the words to start with. It may be that we can capitalise on sleep best if the information is fresh in our memory before we go to bed. This suggests that timing could play an important role in maximising learning – particularly for children with weaker vocabulary knowledge. For these children, a book at bedtime may be an especially valuable language learning opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
