      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sleep helps us to learn new words, but children with reading comprehension difficulties often have poor memory for new vocabulary. In our recent study, we asked whether their vocabulary problems lie in what happens during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We taught children the names of unusual animals and plants. Some particular favourites were the shaggy &lt;em&gt;komondor&lt;/em&gt; dog and the rainbow &lt;em&gt;deglupta&lt;/em&gt; tree, pictured below&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The words were split across two sets of learning and test sessions. In one set children learned the new words first thing in the morning, and in the other set they learned the new words at the end of the evening. Straight after each learning session, they completed some memory tests for the words they had learned. Children then sat the same tests again 12 and 24 hours later, allowing us to trace how their memory changed over wake and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;komondor.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo of a komondor dog&#34; style=&#34;width: 282px;&#34;/&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;deglupta.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo of a deglupta tree&#34; style=&#34;width: 200px;&#34;/&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children were better at remembering the new words after they had slept. This memory boost lasted across the next day, even when children were tired again the following evening. Sleep was most beneficial when children learned the words right before their bedtime. In fact, when we visited again a month later, children were still better at remembering the words they had learned in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children with reading comprehension difficulties found it harder to learn the new words. Even so, their memory still improved over sleep. Learning close to bedtime may be especially helpful for the children with a vocabulary weakness. Children with poor vocabulary were less likely to show sleep benefits for words learned earlier in the day. Nevertheless, all children showed sleep benefits for words learned in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So sleep is more than an opportunity for rest: it’s important for storing new words in long-term memory. Children with reading comprehension difficulties were equally able to benefit from sleep to retain their new knowledge, even though they found it harder to learn the words to start with. It may be that we can capitalise on sleep best if the information is fresh in our memory before we go to bed. This suggests that timing could play an important role in maximising learning – particularly for children with weaker vocabulary knowledge. For these children, a book at bedtime may be an especially valuable language learning opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tools and tips for collecting spoken responses online</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I gave a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.emma-james.co.uk/talk/06-20-beonline/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; on running multi-session studies online at the 2020 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://beonline.research.sc/2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BeOnline conference&lt;/a&gt;. I mentioned that we had recently collected vocal responses online, but that I didn’t have time to talk about it. So, here’s a little bit more about my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We collected spoken responses as part of a word learning study. 125 participants were recruited via Prolific, and listened to a spoken story containing made-up words. In each of three test sessions (same day, next day, one week later), we asked them to try and recall the made-up words. We presented them with the starting sound for each word, and asked them to try and speak the whole word that they had heard in the story. We were interested in which words participants could remember at each test point, scoring each trial as correct or incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-tools&#34;&gt;The tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiment was programmed in Gorilla, and we collected spoken responses using the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gorilla.sc/support/reference/task-builder-zones#audiorecordingbeta&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;“Audio Recording Zone”&lt;/a&gt;. This zone is still in BETA testing (at the time of posting), which means that Gorilla are still ironing out a few issues. We did some thorough piloting and made it through relatively problem-free, but Gorilla have added some warnings of issues to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zone includes a “Test Mode” option, which is Gorilla’s built-in tool for participants to test whether their microphones are working. This mode creates a short recording of the participant’s voice and plays it back to them so that they can check they can be heard. Note that this relies on their honesty though &amp;ndash; there is no way for the software itself to check sound quality, or for you to know that recordings are OK before the participant proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within your experimental task, you incorporate the zone on the relevant trial screen as you would any other response zone in Gorilla, and set the option to “Record Mode”. This will record a short sound file for each trial, which can be ended by a button press or a timeout (you can see the various setting options in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gorilla.sc/support/reference/task-builder-zones#audiorecordingbeta&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt;). At the end of my experiment, I downloaded a short .mp3 file for each word trial for each participant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03192979&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CheckVocal&lt;/a&gt; (Protopapas, 2007) for scoring each recording as correct or incorrect. CheckVocal is freely available software that was originally designed to process naming data from DMDX software. Although these recordings were collected via Gorilla, it still did the job for me (after converting the files to .wav first). You can download the software from 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/0avasns/CheckVocal&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-tips&#34;&gt;The tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so I’ve only run one experiment &amp;ndash; I don’t have a HUGE wealth of knowledge to offer. But here are the steps I took (or would take next time!) to try and maintain data quality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put a test mode at the very start of your experiment.&lt;/strong&gt; I put this even before the main study information and consent form, as no data is collected at this stage.  Ask participants to change their settings until their audio is clear. If they can’t get it to work, they can return to Prolific with very little time lost, thereby minimising expensive data loss for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeat the test mode&lt;/strong&gt; before the recording part of your task. You might not need to do this, but I repeated the recording tasks in subsequent test sessions and wanted to provide an opportunity for re-adjustment if needed. Plus it doesn’t harm to be a little extra cautious!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create your own test recording.&lt;/strong&gt; The test modes don’t store any data for you, so I added my own test trial. I asked participants to speak “Take me to the task” before starting the experiment, which served three main purposes:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gave me a quick reference trial to check before approving the participant&amp;rsquo;s submission on Prolific. Checking data quality before approval provides an opportunity to query any issues  at a stage when participants are likely to respond.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It provided a reference trial for subsequent scoring. Blank sound files are very hard to interpret (see below), so evidence of the participant’s microphone working during that test session can be helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It reinforced that sound recording was a vital part of the experiment, and that participants shouldn’t try to proceed without it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(And an extra point – it was wonderful listening to all the kind strangers with their various accents asking to be taken to the experiment!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid blank sound files.&lt;/strong&gt; Empty recordings can be very hard to interpret: they tend to consist of only white noise, and/or might be very short. This leaves you with no idea whether the participant didn’t attempt a response or whether the recording didn&amp;rsquo;t work properly. To help with this, we encouraged participants to attempt an answer if they could, and speak “don’t know” or “pass” if not. The majority of participants did this, but I think in future I would keep a reminder on-screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t expect a lab-based environment.&lt;/strong&gt; Before starting this experiment, I had an idealised view that I would be able to tell if a participant wasn’t in an appropriately quiet environment, and that it would be easy to exclude them on that basis. It isn’t. You have no real idea whether that faint music/television is in the same room and whether the participants can hear it through their headphones. You don’t know how distracted that participant is from the children screaming at each other (OK I might have had to exclude &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; trial…). You might even hear your participants take an extra moment to ask their co-habitant to be quiet. Then what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…Think very carefully about the implications of background noise for your research question&lt;/strong&gt;, and remember that you will never have the same control as in the lab. This goes for any online study &amp;mdash; it just becomes more obvious when collecting sound recordings. Of course, you will ask that your participants are in a quiet environment where they are unlikely to be disturbed, but if this is crucial to your experiment then you will really need to spell out exactly what that means and think through your criteria for exclusion. For me, my main measure was the accuracy of the word remembered (response times didn&amp;rsquo;t matter) and I had other ways to ensure that participants were engaging with the task. I was also comparing this experiment to one conducted with children in schools &amp;ndash; background noise and screaming children are pretty common occurrences there too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s all I can think of that might be helpful, but please feel free to leave comments with any further questions or your own tips and experiences. You can read more about the study in our 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://psyarxiv.com/vm5ad&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;recent preprint&lt;/a&gt;, or access the experimental tasks on

&lt;p&gt;Happy data collection!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Puzzle of Vocabulary Growth</title>
      <link>/post/nbr-2017-summary/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/nbr-2017-summary/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Think about doing a jigsaw puzzle. Progress is often slow to begin with. It takes a while to work out how the thousands of tiny pieces fit within the bigger picture. A bit further down the line, you might have an outline. You&amp;rsquo;ve clustered some pieces together in their approximate space. The further you get in building the framework, the easier it becomes for you to place each individual piece. This phenomenon is true of learning new topics too &amp;mdash; we build cognitive frameworks that make it easier to learn related information. Yet, we don&amp;rsquo;t know much about how language learners use their prior knowledge. We asked, do children with better vocabulary knowledge find it easier to learn new words?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;featured.png&#34; width=&#34;200&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look at this question, we re-analysed data from five experiments of word learning in children. Each experiment involved teaching children some made-up words (for example, &lt;em&gt;dolpheg&lt;/em&gt;) that were similar to real words in English (&lt;em&gt;dolphin&lt;/em&gt;). Researchers then tested whether the two words became integrated in vocabulary. The integration task measured how quickly the children could detect a short pause inserted into the real words (e.g., &lt;em&gt;dolph__in&lt;/em&gt;), to see whether the made-up words were competing for recognition. When a new word is integrated into vocabulary, response times slow down. The studies each found that sleep was important for this integration to happen: the new words interfered with children’s ability to process real words only when tested the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We re-analysed the data from these experiments to look at how word learning might depend on children&amp;rsquo;s prior knowledge. Children’s prior knowledge was assessed using a separate vocabulary test. We found that children with weak prior knowledge were less likely to embed new words into vocabulary overnight. Children with better prior knowledge were more likely to integrate new and known words. So what might be happening differently for these children overnight?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first learn a new word, a region of the brain called the hippocampus creates a memory of it. It stores information about its sound, its meaning, and its connections to words we know. Those known words are stored in neocortical (outer) regions of the brain. During sleep, new memories are reorganised in the brain so that they too become part of this long-term knowledge. This is achieved by the hippocampus replaying and reactivating the new word memory. As a result, the connections between new and known words become stronger, and the new words become part of long-term vocabulary. We think that children with better prior knowledge can make more connections between new and known words during learning. With more connections, they experience bigger benefits from memory replay during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who have a better language framework seem to more readily lay down each word “piece” of the language puzzle overnight. However, there are many reasons why children who do well at vocabulary assessments might also do well on these measures of word learning. Our research is trying to understand this relationship better. Which aspects of learning benefit most from prior knowledge? Do adults rely on prior knowledge more than children? How can this help us to understand atypical language development? I’ll be addressing these questions in the coming months. By better understanding how children use their existing knowledge during word learning, we hope to better understand why some children lag behind in vocabulary growth. Our finding that existing knowledge supports later &lt;em&gt;integration&lt;/em&gt; of new words into long-term memory tells us that the answer might lie beyond initial vocabulary instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identifying difficulties in reading comprehension</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Approximately 5-10% of children are thought to have difficulties with reading comprehension despite being able to read very accurately. Together with Jessie Ricketts, Danielle Colenbrander, Lisa Henderson, and Holly Joseph, we recently held a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/york.ac.uk/poor-comprehender-workshop/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;workshop to discuss research in this field&lt;/a&gt;. A key aim was to think about current practices for identifying children with specific reading comprehension difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following on from the workshop, we are combining data from previous projects to understand differences in measures of reading comprehension. We want to know whether currently used assessments for reading comprehension identify the same kinds of comprehension difficulties as previous measures, so that we can continue to build upon this research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Studies of word learning and consolidation have tempting practical implications. &lt;em&gt;Can we target sleep problems to help with learning difficulties? Might we remember information better if we sleep straight after learning it?&lt;/em&gt; However, our understanding of sleep and word learning mostly comes from lab experiments, which control lots of other things about the learning environment. This means that the benefits of sleep might not be as striking in real-world learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, I ask whether there is observable evidence for sleep-associated benefits in everyday language learning. Using app data from the foreign language-learning platform 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.memrise.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memrise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we are testing whether memory for new words is better after a period of sleep compared to a period of wake. If it is, we can start to explore what else might support vocabulary learning in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding memory processes across development</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The events we experience contain lots of different types of information, such as where we are, the people we are with, and the objects around us. These details are bound together in our memory for the event, making it easy for us to remember the different elements together. For example, we might experience going to the park with a relative and finding a lost handbag there, and later find we remember that story upon visiting the park again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a postdoc in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aidanhorner.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;York Episodic Memory Lab&lt;/a&gt;, I worked on a project trying to understand the processes that support this kind of memory, and how they change across development. We had to make some changes to the classic research tasks to make them child-friendly, which unintentionally ended up 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://psyarxiv.com/pd9us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;telling us a bit about the processes involved in itself&lt;/a&gt;! The developmental aspect of the study is still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Individual differences in word learning and consolidation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My PhD research aimed to understand individual differences in word learning and consolidation. Why do some children find word learning harder than others, and what happens to word memories in the longer term? Together with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academicstaff/lh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr Lisa Henderson&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academicstaff/mgg5/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Professor Gareth Gaskell&lt;/a&gt;, we looked at how word learning might build on existing vocabulary knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We approached this question in three main ways. First, we looked at how individuals&amp;rsquo; existing vocabulary knowledged predicted their ability to learn and consolidate new words. Second, we manipulated the ways in which new words could relate to prior knowledge, and looked at how it affected word learning success. Third, we looked at children who often find word learning difficult, as is characteristic of children with reading comprehension difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The role of morphological awareness in reading comprehension</title>

      <guid>/project/ma-lancaster/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After completing my undergraduate degree, I worked on an ESRC-funded project on the relations between morphological awareness and reading comprehension, led by Professor Kate Cain (Lancaster University) and Professor Xiuli Tong (The University of Hong Kong). You can find out about this project here:
