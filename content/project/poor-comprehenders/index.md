Approximately 5-10% of children are thought to have difficulties with reading comprehension despite being able to read very accurately. Together with Jessie Ricketts, Danielle Colenbrander, Lisa Henderson, and Holly Joseph, we recently held a [workshop to discuss research in this field](https://sites.google.com/york.ac.uk/poor-comprehender-workshop/home). A key aim was to think about current practices for identifying children with specific reading comprehension difficulties. 

Following on from the workshop, we are combining data from previous projects to understand differences in measures of reading comprehension. We want to know whether currently used assessments for reading comprehension identify the same kinds of comprehension difficulties as previous measures, so that we can continue to build upon this research.
