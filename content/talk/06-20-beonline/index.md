abstract: "Memory researchers often want to assess how new information is consolidated or forgotten over prolonged periods of time. Running multi-session studies online requires significant investment from participants and researchers alike, and can be a costly endeavour if things go wrong. This talk will provide tips for assessing and maintaining data quality during learning and retrieval tasks. We will consider the administrative load of running multi-session studies, and ways to ease the stress of tracking eligible participants. While online studies can be an extraordinarily rapid form of data collection, appropriate pacing during multi-session experiments is important for both minimising data loss and maintaining sanity."
