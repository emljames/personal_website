title: "PhD Opportunities [2025 start]"
---

I am keen to support PhD applications in the domains of learning, language, and/or literacy development. Some suggested project remits are described below that align with my current work, but these are by no means prescriptive. Potential applicants are encouraged to get in touch discuss alternative ideas that they think would be a good fit to the research we conduct at York.

1.  **How do we use morphological knowledge to support new word learning?**
2.  **How do adolescents learn and consolidate new words across school subjects?**
3.  **How do retrieval practice and sleep interact in boosting word knowledge?**

The Department of Psychology at York has wide-ranging facilities relevant to conducting research in this area, including eye-tracking and a range of neuroimaging methods available at [York Neuroimaging Centre](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/research/york-neuroimaging-centre/) (including fMRI, MEG, sleep lab). For those wishing to conduct developmental research, the department prioritises good research partnerships in the local community through [SUNRAY](https://sunray.york.ac.uk/).

### What funding is available? 

The Department of Psychology runs a competitive scheme for departmental studentships (typically ~5 per year), and also supports applications for the White Rose Doctoral Training Partnerships ESRC studentships. Students are encouraged to apply to both schemes, which typically have a deadline in early January. Please see the [departmental information](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/prospective/postgraduate/research/funding/). Overseas applicants should consider whether there are other funding opportunities available from their home country.

### I'm interested! What now? 

Potential applications should send me an email in the first instance ([emma.james\@york.ac.uk](mailto:emma.james@york.ac.uk)). This email should include details about your research interests, and any particular skills that you would like to develop over your PhD. Please also include a copy of your CV.

From there, we will discuss our overlap in research interests and whether York would be a good fit for your PhD research. If we decide to proceed with an application, I will then support you in developing a research proposal ahead of the funding deadline in January. This process takes time: the sooner you get in touch, the better.
