I am currently based at the University of Oxford, as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Experimental Psychology and Lecturer at St. Catherine's College. From October 2022, I will return to the University of York as a Lecturer in Psychology.

I am currently the Early Career Researcher Representative on the committee for the Experimental Psychology Society, and would be very glad to discuss ideas for supporting the ECR community.

You can find out more about my research projects below.
